    <!-- DETAILED AND BORING ALCOHOL POLICY-->
      <article id="alcoholPolicy">
        <h2>Alcohol Policy</h2>
        <p>Absolutely NO alcoholic beverages are allowed on the primises OTHER THAN wine from our winery.  This is a legal requirement that applies to “bonded facilities” (wineries) and your entire group will be asked to leave if even one person violates this rule, so please comply. Public intoxication is unlawful, regardless of whether you have a designated driver or are in a limo/bus/shuttle. If a group arrives, and our Constable determines that anyone in that group is intoxicated, that group will be asked to leave. This policy also applies to individuals arriving in private cars. It is against the law to serve or sell alcohol to an intoxicated person. Winery servers cannot serve anyone they suspect is over or near the “legal limit” of alcohol.  It is a judgment call and the winery management will support our TABC trained employees. If you are advised you cannot be served, please do not argue with our staff. Additionally, wineries, by law, can refuse service to the entire group if ONE person is considered “over the limit” of alcohol.
